What I'll do next

1. Run `git status` to show current state.
2. Create a branch `feature/git-tutorial` and switch to it.
3. Stage and commit this file.
4. Push the branch to `origin` and show the log.

Teacher's notes (short):

- `git status` shows uncommitted changes and current branch.
- `git checkout -b <branch>` creates and switches to a new branch.
- `git add .` stages changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "message"` records staged changes.
- `git push -u origin <branch>` uploads branch and sets upstream.
- `git log --oneline -n 5` shows recent commits.

Files changed in this demo:

- `git-tutorial.md` (added)

If you want, I can now open a Pull Request on GitHub for this branch.
