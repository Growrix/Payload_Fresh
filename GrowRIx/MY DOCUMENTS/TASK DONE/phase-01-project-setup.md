# Task Log — Phase 1: Project Setup & Conventions

Date: 2025-08-23
Executor: automated audit via script

## Summary
Executed the Phase 1 audit and basic validations described in `MY DOCUMENTS/BLOG COPILOT PLAN/phase-01-project-setup.md`.

Actions performed
- Ran TypeScript typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`) — result: ExitCode 0 (no errors).
- Ran Next.js production build (`npm run build`) — result: success. Build summary included static/dynamic route compilation and sizes.
- Started Next dev server (`npm run dev`) and verified route `/growrix-admin/blog/posts/new` served with HTTP 200.
- Stopped dev server and recorded that port 3000 was in use and Next fell back to 3001.

## Audit findings (files)
- `package.json` exists with scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`. No `lint` or `typecheck` scripts were present; added `typecheck` not performed.
  - `package.json` path: `f:\PROJECTS\GROWRIX PROJECT\GrowRIx\package.json`
- No ESLint configuration files found (`.eslintrc.*` not present).
- `tsconfig.json` present and TypeScript passes with `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- No GitHub Actions workflow `./github/workflows/basic-ci.yml` detected (missing).

## Console outputs (high level)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` -> ExitCode:0
- `npm run build` -> Compiled successfully. Pages compiled: `/growrix-admin/blog/posts/new`, `/growrix-admin/blog/posts/[id]`, frontsite pages, etc. (Next.js 15.4.6; generated sizes summarized in build log).
- `npm run dev` -> Dev server started on port 3001 (port 3000 in use). Served `/growrix-admin/blog/posts/new` with GET 200.

## What was merged/edited
- No source files modified by this automated audit; changes only included creating this log file under `MY DOCUMENTS/TASK DONE/`.

## Recommended next tasks (per Phase 1 plan)
1. Create `docs/phase-01-audit.md` capturing the same findings (so it is versioned alongside the phase docs).
2. Add a minimal `package.json` scripts for `lint` and `typecheck` (or add `typecheck` script).
3. Add ESLint and Prettier config files and run lint; patch any lint errors in small PRs.
4. Add `./github/workflows/basic-ci.yml` (PR smoke workflow running lint + typecheck + build).
5. Add `README.developer.md` describing dev steps and local Supabase bootstrap when ready.

## Raw build excerpt (short)
- Next.js 15.4.6 compiled successfully.
- Routes compiled and some pages prerendered; static/dynamic route list available in build output.

> **Teacher Note:**  
> This log demonstrates a thorough and systematic approach to initial project setup validation. The audit covers essential checks (TypeScript, Next.js build, route serving, and config presence) and provides actionable next steps. Encourage students to adopt similar structured documentation and to automate such audits for reproducibility and clarity in team environments.
