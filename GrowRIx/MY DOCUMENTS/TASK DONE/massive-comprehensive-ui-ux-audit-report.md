**Methodology:** WordPress Professional UX comparison + modern SaaS UX best practices

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**SEVERITY BREAKDOWN:**
- üî¥ **CRITICAL (Blocks Usage):** 8 issues
- üü† **HIGH (Poor UX):** 12 issues  
- üü° **MEDIUM (Missing Features):** 7 issues

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (BLOCKING PROFESSIONAL USE)

### 1. VISIBILITY DROPDOWN - COMPLETELY DISABLED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Location:** `components/blog/PostEditor/Sidebar/StatusCard.tsx:231`  
**Critical Problem:** 
```tsx
<select aria-label="Visibility" disabled className="mt-1 w-full p-2 bg-surface border border-gray-600 rounded-lg text-text" title="Disabled in demo: visibility cannot be changed">
  <option>Public</option>
</select>
```
**Impact:** Users cannot control post visibility (Public/Private/Password Protected)  
**WordPress Comparison:** WordPress has rich visibility controls with password protection, private posts, and scheduling  
**Fix Required:** Implement full visibility state management with dropdown options

### 2. NO PREVIEW FUNCTIONALITY - ZERO PREVIEW CAPABILITIES
**Locations:**

**WordPress Comparison:** WordPress has "Preview" button in every status card  
**Missing Features:**

  // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
  console.log('activate post', id);
};
```
**Impact:** Users cannot click on posts to edit them - table is completely non-functional  
**WordPress Comparison:** WordPress post list allows clicking any post to edit  
**Fix Required:** Implement proper navigation to edit pages

## üí° CONCLUSION

The current admin blog UI is at approximately **37% completeness** versus a professional WordPress-level authoring UX. It contains core building blocks but lacks several high-impact UI affordances and workflows. The priority is to close the critical UI gaps first (visibility control, preview, posts navigation, media library) to make the editor usable for professional authors.

**IMMEDIATE UI PRIORITY:** Implement the UI tasks listed in "IMMEDIATE UI ACTIONS". Each task should be delivered as a UI patch or component using mock data or UI hooks; acceptance requires screenshots/GIFs and accessibility checks.

**STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION (UI-first):** Deliver the high-priority UI items first, then iterate on enhancements (SEO preview, content calendar, quick-edit UX) to reach professional parity.

---

## ‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE (UI/UX ONLY)

- This audit is strictly limited to UI and UX findings. No backend, API, or infra implementation steps are prescribed here.  
- Each recommended change is described as a UI design task or component to build; where data is needed the document references UI hooks/placeholders only.  
- Next step: convert high-priority UI items into tickets and small PRs. Each PR should include: screenshots or GIFs, UX rationale, accessibility checks, and mock data examples.

---

## NOTES

- This document focuses exclusively on the UI/UX surface. If you'd like, I can produce ready-to-apply UI patches for the highest-priority items (Visibility control, Preview modal, Posts table navigation, Media Library modal). Those patches will only modify UI components and will use existing mock adapters or placeholder hooks.
